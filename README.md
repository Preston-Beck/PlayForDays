# PlayForDays
This project will allow users to share times that they are available to play sports together.
Sports can be added to the database with information required equipment. Sporting Events are
then created and every even has a corresponding sport. The events have properties about time
and location. After an event has been created, players can be added to the events.

The purpose of this is to encourage people to find time to play sports that fit around their schedule.
Lots of people are busy but everyone has time for things if they are interested in them.
This removes the stress of league play in which the time constraints are strict and important.
