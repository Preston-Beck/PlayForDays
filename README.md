# PlayForDays
This project will allow users to share times that they are available to play sports together.
It takes a sport and assigns it a number of events. Those events have specific times in which they run.
When a player is available during the time the event is running, they are added to that event.

The purpose of this is to encourage people to find time to play sports that fit around their schedule.
Lots of people are busy but everyone has time for things if they are interested in them.
This removes the stress of league play in which the time constraints are strict and important.
